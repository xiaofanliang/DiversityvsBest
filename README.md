# Is "hiring the smartest" the best strategy for team performance? 
---
A project under the supervision of [Dr. Eric Bonabeau](http://www.icosystem.com/about-us/management-team/bonabeau/) to analyze the utility of diversity in team performance under various kinds of tasks. The model aims to examinate the myth that "hiring the smartest" is the best strategy for companies to maximize their performance gains deeper insights into the tradeoff between diversity and high technical skills. In the NetLogo Model, we simulated different team types (different combination of technical abilities and perspectives) competing to finish different tasks that may require different extents of technical abilities and perspectives.  

You can see the write-up of analysis [here](https://github.com/xiaofanliang/DiversityvsBest/blob/master/DiversityvsBest_DataAnalysis.pdf)

The simulation is written in NetLogo Software. You can see the code [here](https://github.com/xiaofanliang/DiversityvsBest/blob/master/Diversityvs.Best.nlogo). 

Here are a few selections of the visuals for NetLogo Interface and Data Analysis.
